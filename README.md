# Google Code Jam 2019
These are my messy solutions for [Google Code Jam 2019](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive/2019) in **Python 3**. May only update after each round so no cheating :)

In each folder, the following files can be present:
* Vanilla files from the problem:
  * `problem.md`: A Markdown-version of the problem
  * `sample.in`: Sample input directly from `problem.md`
  * `interactive_runner.py`: [Interactive runner](https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/interactive_runner.py) offered by Code Jam. See explanation on [Code Jam FAQ](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/faq). (Only in interactive problems)
  * `testing_tool.py`: Testing tool offered by an interactive problem. (Only in interactive problems)
* My files (Uploaded **after** round ends):
  * `analysis.md`: My analysis for the problem
  * `solution-P|F|U[+].py`: My best attempt with results marked in the name. E.g., the solution passed 1st but failed 2nd test set and did not have 3rd set checked would be named `solution-sub-PFU.py`
  * Other files, if present, will be explained in `analysis.md`

## Why Python 3?
It's good enough; it runs fast enough; I'm lazy; it has much handled for me.
